# Separated Recurrent Model for NPLab3D

![material/DesignPlot.png](Network Design)

This experiment tries to test PHLSTM-Codec's power on 3D motion dataset. Before it, I have tried original PHLSTM-Codec on NPLab3D dataset, and obtained frame-mean as prediction. However, even earlier, I tested *RecCO* model on NPLab3D and obtained predictions that can get a sense of motion (very weak though). This time, I would like to combine them together. This design is essential a codec for *RecCO* unit.
